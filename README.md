# Igor Fesenko, PhD

## Summary
Ph.D. in Genetics with over a decade of extensive experience in scientific research, multi-omics data analysis, and visualization, as well as statistical analysis. My responsibilities include designing and coordinating research projects, preparing manuscripts, writing grant proposals, managing grant applications, and leading interdisciplinary research teams.

I have a proven track record of successfully overseeing and driving innovative scientific investigations, particularly in functional genomics and proteomics. As a lecturer, I have demonstrated expertise in designing and delivering undergraduate and graduate courses in genetics and molecular biology.

My unique background in both experimental studies and computational analysis enables me to contribute significantly to expanding scientific knowledge and effecting positive change in the field.

## Skills
- Programming Languages: Python, R, Bash, SQL
- Good experience in data analysis and visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, scikit-learn, stats, and more
- Effective in mass-spectrometry data analysis: MaxQuant, Mascot, X!Tandem, SearchGUI, PEAKS;
- Skilled at Ribo-seq, RNA-seq и nanopore sequencing: Bowtie, Hisat2, Trimgalore, Trimmomatic, FeatureCounts, edgeR, Guppy 4, minimap, StringTie, scanpy
- Effective in alignment of DNA and protein sequences (MAFFT, Clustal, Muscle, T-coffee, etc.) and phylogenetic analysis (Phylip package, PhyML, MEGA, HyPhy, etc.)
- Skilled at protein structure prediction (ESMFold, AlphaFold2, foldseek, DALI)

## Projects 
**Uncovering the role of microproteins in bacterial genomes** ([link](https://github.com/IgorFesenko/prokariotic_smORFs))  
- I systematically examined their coding potential, structural features, evolutionary conservation, and selection regime of small genes in Enterobacteriaceae genomes. 

**Studying the roles of long non-coding RNAs in formation of plant cell proteome** ([link](https://github.com/IgorFesenko/smORF_analysis))
- New families of functional peptides that are coded by small ORFs in different groups of plants were found 
 
**Analysis of plant and animal peptidomes** ([[link](https://github.com/IgorFesenko/Peptidome_review))
- Methods for the extraction and analysis of endogenous peptides were developed
